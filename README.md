## Getting started

1. Install Phantom or MetaMask and create an account.
1. Get some Sepolia Ethereum from a faucet (for example
   [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)).
1. Reload the page and start exploring!

If you encounter any problems make sure to submit an issue.

## How it works

Share small pieces of text (_kweets_) with everyone. Vote the kweets you like
and the most voted will appear at the top of the feed. All data is stored
exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain. No ads, no preferred content, it's
entirely managed by the users.

## The goal

Kwitter was not built to be a scalable social network but <strong>to simply
demonstrate how blockchain technology can be used to improve the social media
domain.</strong> It's therefore deployed on a testnet, which provides similar
functionality as the main network while being free to use.

Everything is transparent, all data is public for everyone and there is no
censoring whatsoever (of course in a real decentralized social network public
protocols should be implemented in order to prevent bad content).
